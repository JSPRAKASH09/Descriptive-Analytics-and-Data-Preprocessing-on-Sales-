Descriptive Analysis and Data Preprocessing Summary
Introduction: This analysis performs descriptive analytics and visualizes data distributions to preprocess the Sales & Discounts dataset for further analysis.

Descriptive Analytics for Numerical Columns: Key statistical measures—mean, median, mode, and standard deviation—are computed for numerical columns to understand central tendencies and variability.

Data Visualization:

Histograms show the distribution of numerical columns, highlighting skewness and outliers.
Boxplots identify outliers and the interquartile range.
Bar charts visualize categorical data frequencies, providing insights into category distributions.
Standardization of Numerical Variables: Numerical columns are standardized using z-score normalization to ensure uniformity across the dataset, enhancing its suitability for analytical models.

Conversion of Categorical Data into Dummy Variables: Categorical variables are transformed into dummy variables (one-hot encoding) to make them compatible with machine learning algorithms.

Conclusion: The analysis highlights key findings, emphasizing the importance of preprocessing steps like standardization and one-hot encoding in preparing the dataset for effective analysis and machine learning applications.
